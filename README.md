Pets App
===================================
1. Built an android application that store the pets info in SQLite
Database.

2. Conceptualized and implemented content providers which acts as a
layer between database and activity so that there is no invalid data in
database.
3. Implemented Content URIs and URI Matcher to identify data in a
provider.

4. Implemented various Android framework classes such as Cursor
Loader which help us to queries the Content Resolver with the
specific URI and return a Cursor. It also optimized the app by
performing the expensive operation on background thread.
